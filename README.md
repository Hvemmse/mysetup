feat: Generate and hash random passwords

This code generates 4 random passwords by concatenating 4 random words from a file, each word's first 4 characters and a random number between 0 and 9. It also randomly capitalizes a letter in each password. The password and its hash are then printed.

Functions and variables are well documented, making the code easier to understand and maintain. The code uses the SHA-256 hash function to hash the passwords.

# password_generator.py
